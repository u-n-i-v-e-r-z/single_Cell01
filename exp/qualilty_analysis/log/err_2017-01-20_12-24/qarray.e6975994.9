No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /home/aheurteau/work/LBME/single_Cell01/raw/fastq//29645-C-64_CGTACTAG-CTCTCTAT_L001_R1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	9	CTGTCTCTTATA	501	1.80
smallRNA	0	ATGGAATTCTCG	501	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	501	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 9). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)
